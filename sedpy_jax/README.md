# sedpy_jax

**JAX-accelerated SED fitting tools, filter handling, and broadband photometry projection for astronomy.**

Built as a modern, GPU-ready reimplementation of `sedpy` to support differentiable, scalable spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting â€” ideal for simulation-based inference, gradient-based samplers (e.g. HMC, NUTS), and high-throughput photometric pipelines.

## ðŸš€ Features

- ðŸ§  **Fully JAX-compatible** filter operations and broadband projection
- ðŸ“¦ Clean, modular implementation of the `Filter` and `FilterSet` classes
- ðŸŒˆ Easy visualization of filter transmission curves with colormap scaling
- ðŸ§® Accurate AB and Vega magnitude computation
- ðŸ“š Utility functions for wavelength conversion, rebinning, and interpolation
- ðŸ§° Built-in effective wavelength, pivot wavelength, width, and zero-point computation

ðŸ›  Example: Using FilterSet to Project SEDs

from sedpy_jax.observate import FilterSet
import jax.numpy as jnp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load a set of filters
fset = FilterSet(['sdss_u0', 'sdss_g0', 'sdss_r0', 'acs_wfc_f435w'])

# Plot transmission curves
fset.display(normalize=True)
plt.show()

# Project an SED onto filters
wave = jnp.linspace(3000, 10000, 500)
flux = jnp.exp(-0.5 * ((wave - 6000) / 800)**2)  # toy SED
maggies = fset.get_sed_maggies(flux, sourcewave=wave)

### âœ¨ Suggestions

- Save an example filter plot as `docs/images/filter_transmission_example.png` to show off in the README.
- Use `rich` or `tabulate` in code if you want to generate the property table programmatically.
- Add badges (`PyPI`, `Tests`, `Docs`) once you're ready to publish or CI test.
